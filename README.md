# Basic Recipe Website

## About
This is the code for a **basic** HTML website with links to a few recipes.
This project was made during the Foundations Course of the Odin Project.

## Goals
* Set up a baisc HTML website with multiple pages
* Create working links between pages
* Use GitHub commits to track and upload changes

## Thoughts
I had some fun creating this website. Basic HTML allows for some simple yet functional sites that are entertaining to create. I am not really a chef so I started losing steam when adding the recipes. However, this was a valuable exercise in how to use basic HTML to design a website with multiple linked and functioning pages.
