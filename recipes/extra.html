    <h1 class="header">One Extra Recipe</h1>
    <p>To be honest I'm getting a little tired of adding recipes.
        I never wanted to be a chef. I don't want to give you a life
        story in between recipe steps on my baking blog. I apologize deeply
        if my recipes so far have been sub-par. Just know that I tried.
        Not necessarily my <strong>hardest</strong>, but I definitely 
        did try a little bit to make some contributions to the culinary
        world.
    </p>
    <p>To everyone who has made it this far:
    </p>
    <p>Thank you. I love you. To show my appreciation, here is a GIF
        of a dancing dog.
    </p>
    <p><em>Enjoy!</em></p>
    <p>-Cole</p>
