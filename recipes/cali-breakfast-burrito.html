    <h2>Mmmmm Burritos</h2>
    <p>What are the greatest human achievements? 
        You probably have a list that looks something like this:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Pyramids</li>
        <li>Space exploration</li>
        <li>Creation of the Internet</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I, on the other hand, believe that one of the single greatest advances
        in all of humanity was when some beautiful being asked themselves the
        question <em>"What if I put a full meal in an edible wrapper?"</em>
    </p>
    <p>It was at that point that humanity was forever altered. No longer
        did we need to stay in one location to eat; suddenly we were a race of
        beings that could fuel themselves <strong>on the go</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>That first pioneer of mobile meals paved the way to one of the best
        inventions in culinary history: <strong>The California Breakfast Burrito</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>Disclaimer:</p>
    <p>Just like with the last recipe, I am just here to code and I'm not
        really a chef. I am just someone who is passionate about burritos and 
        writing HTML. <strong><em>Good luck!</em></strong>
