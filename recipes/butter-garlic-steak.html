    <h2>Who doesn't love a great steak?</h2>
    <h4>(If you're a meat-eater at least)</h4>
    <p>Let's be honest, you're not here to read a recipe for the best steak
        that you've even eaten. You're just here to look at home HTML code on
        a very basic website that I have made. Well that's okay but you are 
        <strong>truly missing out</strong> if you don't at least <em>read through this</em>
    </p>
    <p>Who knows, maybe you'll like what you see and decide to give this recipe a shot?</p>
    <h3>First off: some secrets to making a great steak</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Let the steak warm up for a while outside the fridge</li>
        <li>Put salt and pepper on the steak right before it goes in the pan</li>
        <li>Use a high quality pan (preferably cast iron) and let it get super hot</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ingredients List</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Steak. Here are a few cuts I like:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Ribeye</li>
            <li>New York Strip</li>
            <li>Filet Mignon</li>
        </ul>
        <li>1/4 stick of Butter (I prefer Kerrygold or any grass-fed butter)</li>
        <li>3-6 Cloves of Garlic (depending on taste preferences)</li>
        <li>1 Sprig of Fresh Rosemary or Sage (I prefer Sage)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>Salt and pepper the steak to taste.</li>
        <li>Get your pan hot.</li>
        <li>Put a small amount of oil in the pan.</li>
        <li>Sear the steak on both sides as well as long edges, just until brown.</li>
        <li>Turn heat down to medium and put butter into the pan.</li>
        <li>Once butter has melted, place garlic and herb(s) into the pan.</li>
        <li>Tilt the pan so that the butter runs to one side.</li>
        <li>Using a spoon, baste the steak with the butter.</li>
        <li>Keep going until you think the steak is cooked.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Good Job! You have a great steak!</h3>

    <p>Disclaimer:</p>
    <p>As I mentioned above, I'm not really here to make a cooking blog. I'm just
        trying to get better at coding. So don't be mad if your steak turns out badly.
        If you burn your house down making my recipe then honestly that's on you.
        I'm just here to write some freaking HTML. <strong><em>Good luck!</em></strong>
